# Scaffold a crewmate brief or persistent secondmate charter at
# data/<task-id>/brief.md under the active firstmate home.
# For ordinary tasks, the standard Setup/Rules/Definition-of-done contract is
# filled in. Firstmate then replaces the {TASK} placeholder with the task
# description, acceptance criteria, and context, and may adjust other sections
# when the task genuinely deviates (e.g. working an existing external PR instead
# of shipping a new one).
# Usage: fm-brief.sh <task-id> <repo-name> [--scout] [--herdr-lab] [--visual-evidence]
#        fm-brief.sh <task-id> --secondmate {<project>...|--no-projects}
#   --scout writes the scout contract instead: the deliverable is a report at
#   data/<task-id>/report.md (no branch, no push, no PR) and the worktree is scratch.
#   --secondmate writes a persistent secondmate charter. The project list
#   is cloned into the secondmate home, while the natural-language scope
#   tells the main firstmate when to route work there; routine churn stays in its own home;
#   captain-relevant escalations and marked from-firstmate replies append to this
#   home's status file.
#   --no-projects writes a project-less charter for a domain whose subject is the
#   firstmate repo itself (its home is a firstmate worktree, its crews take pooled
#   worktrees of the same repo). It is mutually exclusive with a project list, and
#   omitting both still fails loudly so an accidental omission is never silent.
#   Set FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER='<charter>' to fill the charter text.
#   Set FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE='<scope>' to write a routing scope distinct from the charter text.
#   --herdr-lab is mandatory when the task will issue Herdr lifecycle commands.
#   It adds the hard isolation contract backed by bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh.
#   The flag must be explicit because {TASK} is filled after scaffolding and the
#   caller-supplied repo string cannot reliably identify this repo. Briefs made
#   without it carry a loud declaration so an omitted contract cannot be silent.
#   --visual-evidence adds the visual-evidence contract to a ship brief, for work
#   that changes a user-visible surface. The generated contract requires: a
#   "before" that is a capture of the real surface as it stands today, unless the
#   surface does not exist yet; an "after" that is always an artifact, preferring
#   a capture of the change running in a throwaway prototype, then a mock rendered
#   in the project's own design system, then a diagram; one tight capture per
#   claim placed beside that claim; cropping and annotation down to the region
#   that changed; and prose reserved for rationale, trade-offs, and open
#   questions. The after has one carve-out, for motion, timing, or a measurement
#   no still capture can hold, which the worker must name and justify; an
#   unattached "I could not show it" stays a missing after.
#   The medium follows the surface (a browser view is a screenshot of the real
#   route, CLI output is the real transcript of the real command, a generated file
#   is its real content), so the contract fits non-browser surfaces too.
#   Prototypes and captures are built inside the task worktree under a
#   self-ignoring .fm-scratch/ and are never committed to the code branch; the
#   artifacts that are presented are copied to this task's own record directory,
#   data/<task-id>/evidence/, which the flag also names as the single exception to
#   the brief's stay-inside-the-worktree rule 2 - the same class of write as the
#   status file, scoped to this task and nothing else.
#   Each artifact is linked by its path beside the claim it evidences - in the
#   pull request body as soon as it exists, whoever opened it, or in the hand-back
#   when the mode opens none. The link is the home-relative path
#   data/<task-id>/evidence/<file>, never the absolute path the copy step needs,
#   so a body that may be published carries no account name or home layout. Links
#   are appended to an existing body rather than replacing it, because a project
#   can require a signature or a section there that a replacement drops; and
#   because the pipeline owns a body it opened and a rerun republishes it, the
#   links are re-checked and re-added before the task reports done.
#   The prose must carry that claim on its own, because a reviewer who is not on
#   this machine cannot open the file: for upstream-facing work the artifacts are
#   the captain's verification rather than the upstream reviewer's, which is an
#   accepted limitation and the reason captures go to no other host.
#   Prototyping the after costs budget when the worker chooses and only repays a
#   review round later, so the brief has to require it or no worker spends it.
#   The flag is explicit because {TASK} is filled in after scaffolding, so the
#   scaffold cannot tell whether the work is visual. It is ship-only, and omitting
#   it emits nothing at all: unlike Herdr lifecycle isolation, a missing visual
#   contract costs a review round, not safety, so briefs for work with no
#   user-visible surface must not carry a declaration.
# For ship tasks, the definition of done is shaped by the project's delivery mode
# (data/projects.md via fm-project-mode.sh; see the project-management skill
# and AGENTS.md task lifecycle):
#   no-mistakes  implement -> /no-mistakes pipeline -> PR -> captain merge (default)
#   direct-PR    implement -> push + open PR via gh-axi (no pipeline) -> captain merge
#   local-only   implement on branch, stop and report "ready in branch" (no push/PR);
#                captain approves, firstmate merges to local main
# Ship briefs begin with a worktree-isolation assertion before the branch step.
# Scout tasks ignore mode - their deliverable is a report, not a merge.
# Every scaffold's status protocol distinguishes the configured
# declared-external-wait verb (FM_CLASSIFY_PAUSED_VERB, default "paused") from
# "blocked:": pause for a known external wait expected to clear on its own,
# blocked when firstmate must act.
# Ship tasks include a project-memory section so durable project-intrinsic
# learnings can be committed to AGENTS.md through the project's delivery path;
# it carries the AGENTS.md authoring bar (widely useful knowledge only, pointers
# over copied detail) and has the crewmate add the fm-ensure-agents-md.sh
# self-governance section when a touched project AGENTS.md lacks it.
# Refuses to overwrite an existing brief.

# Routing scope
$SECONDMATE_SCOPE

# Project clones
$PROJECT_CLONES_BODY

# Operating model
You are in an isolated firstmate home. The local \`AGENTS.md\` is your job description, and your local \`data/\`, \`state/\`, \`config/\`, and \`projects/\` dirs are yours to operate.
$PROJECT_CLONES_NOTE
Delegate project work to your own crewmates with the normal firstmate lifecycle: brief, spawn, status, watcher, steer, teardown, and recovery.
Do not invent a second delegation system.
You do not generate your own work.
Act only on tasks the main firstmate routes to you.
Never start a survey, audit, or "find improvements" sweep on your own initiative; that is not your job and it is unwanted.

# Requests from the main firstmate
You are a firstmate in your own home, so an incoming message reaches you in your own chat.
You must distinguish who it is from, because the answer goes to a different place.
A request relayed to you by the main firstmate is tagged with a leading \`$FM_FROMFIRST_LABEL\` marker followed by an invisible system separator; this marker is untypable, so a human never produces it.
When a message carries that marker, do the work, then respond via the STATUS/ESCALATION path below, never only in this chat: the main firstmate does not read your chat, so a chat-only reply is lost.
Marked requests also carry a privacy-safe \`corr=<id>\` token after the marker; include that exact token in your parent status reply (or in the status pointer to a detailed doc) so the parent can correlate the answer.
Optional helper: \`bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh\` can append a correlated status line for you, but a plain \`echo\` that includes the same \`corr=<id>\` is equally valid - do not depend on the helper being present.
For a terse result, a status line is the whole answer.
For a detailed answer (an investigation, a plan, an audit), write it to a doc under your home's \`data/\` and append a status line that points to that doc - the scout-report pattern - so the main firstmate is woken and can read it.
Before treating an investigation or visual review as complete, load \`decision-hold-lifecycle\` from this home's \`.agents/skills/\` and pass its shared completion gate.
A message with NO marker is the captain typing directly into your pane: treat it as authoritative captain intervention and stay conversational exactly as you would for any captain message; do not force it onto the status path.

# Escalation to main firstmate
Handle routine work yourself.
Report only true captain-relevant outcomes or a declared external wait by appending one line:
   \`echo "{state}: {one short line}" >> $STATUS_FILE\`
States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` (distinct from \`blocked:\`) only when your domain is deliberately idling on a known external wait you expect to clear on its own; use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need firstmate to act.
Use this only for material phase changes, a captain decision, a real blocker, a failure, or work ready for review.
This is also how you return the answer to a marked from-firstmate request above.
A marked request requires one correlated answer after the work; it does not require a separate receipt or start acknowledgement.
Never append \`working:\` merely to acknowledge receipt or announce that a marked request has started.
When a routed-work phase has a supervisor-actionable material change worth reporting under the rule above, give that reported phase a stable key.
If its first reportable event is \`working [key=<work-slug>]: {material phase}\`, use the same key on its later \`$PAUSED_VERB\`, \`done\`, \`failed\`, \`needs-decision\`, or \`blocked\` event so the earlier working phase is superseded.
When a keyed phase ends without another reportable state, append \`resolved [key=<work-slug>]: {why it is no longer active}\`.
When a decision you escalated is answered or a blocker clears and your domain resumes, append \`resolved: {how it was decided or unblocked}\` (keyed with \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) so it is durably closed instead of resurfacing behind later unrelated events.
Routine internal supervision, heartbeats, retries, and crewmate churn stay inside your own home and must not touch that status file.

# Definition of done
You are persistent by default. Do not exit just because your queue is empty.
On startup and restart, run normal firstmate bootstrap and recovery through \`bin/fm-session-start.sh\` for your own home, but only to RECONCILE work that is already yours: in-flight crewmates, tracked backlog items, and durable watches recorded in this home.
When you have no assigned or in-flight work after that reconciliation, go idle and wait silently for the main firstmate to route you a task.
An empty queue is a healthy resting state, not a cue to invent work: never spawn a survey, audit, or any self-directed "find work" task on your own initiative.
If this charter cannot be carried out, append \`blocked: {why}\` or \`failed: {why}\` to the main status file and stop.

You are a crewmate: an autonomous worker agent managed by firstmate. Work on your own; do not wait for a human.

# Task
{TASK}

$HERDR_SECTION

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of $REPO, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.
This is a SCOUT task: the deliverable is a written report, not a PR.
The worktree is your laboratory - install, run, edit, and make scratch commits freely; all of it is discarded at teardown.
The report is the only thing that survives, so anything worth keeping must be in it.

# Rules
1. Never push to any remote and never open a PR.
2. Stay inside this worktree; the only files you may write outside it are the report and the status file below.
3. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
   When browser work is finished, first navigate to \`about:blank\`, then close the browser.
   Park first because it is the half that survives failure: an abandoned page keeps rendering at full CPU indefinitely, and parking still holds if the close is missed or the task ends mid-run.
4. Report status by appending one line:
   \`echo "{state}: {one short line}" >> $STATUS_FILE\`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on and the needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step
   FYI progress lines; firstmate reads your pane for that.
   Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` - distinct from \`blocked:\` - ONLY when you are deliberately idling on a
   known external wait you expect to clear on its own (an upstream release, a rate-limit reset):
   firstmate then leaves your idle pane alone and rechecks it on a long cadence instead of
   treating it as a possible wedge. Use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need help.
5. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append \`blocked: {why}\` and stop; firstmate will help.
6. If a decision belongs to a human (product choices, destructive actions),
   append \`needs-decision: {summary of options}\` and stop. Firstmate will reply with the decision.
   When firstmate replies or a blocker clears and you resume, append \`resolved: {how it was decided or unblocked}\` (add the same \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) so the decision or blocker is durably closed and does not keep resurfacing.
7. Never stop, restart, or update the shared \`no-mistakes\` daemon - it is one instance serving
   every lane/home, so restarting it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs. On ANY no-mistakes
   daemon error, append \`blocked: {the daemon error}\` and stop; only firstmate manages the daemon.

# Definition of done
Write your findings to \`$DATA/$ID/report.md\`.
The report must stand alone: what you did, what you found, the evidence (commands run, output, file:line references), and what you recommend.
Before reporting done, read and follow \`$FM_ROOT/.agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md\` and pass its shared completion gate for the report and any visual review.
When the report is complete, append \`done: {one-line conclusion}\` to the status file and stop.
If your findings reveal work that should ship (e.g. you reproduced a bug and the fix is clear), say so in the report; firstmate may promote this task in place, and you would then receive mode-specific ship instructions as a follow-up message.

# Definition of done
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When you believe it is complete, append \`done: {summary}\` to the status file and stop.
Firstmate will then instruct you to run /no-mistakes to validate and ship a PR.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and \`no-mistakes axi run --help\` plus the \`help\` lines in each \`axi\` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
When starting no-mistakes, make \`--intent\` preserve all relevant content from this brief's \`# Task\` section plus every later accepted Firstmate requirement, clarification, constraint, exclusion, and supersession, carrying only each requirement's current accepted form; retain direct requirements instead of substituting a diff summary, and exclude generic operational, status, delivery, and other scaffold boilerplate unless it is task-specific.
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate (rule 6) and stop.
  Firstmate applies the authority contract in its \`AGENTS.md\` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with \`no-mistakes axi respond\` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- Avoid \`--yes\`: it would silently bypass firstmate's authority check and any required captain escalation.

After /no-mistakes reports CI green (the CI-ready return point - do not wait for it to keep monitoring in the background until merge), append \`done: PR {url} checks green\` and stop. You are finished.

This task changes a user-visible surface, so every claim about how it looks must arrive as a capture of the real thing, not as prose.
The medium follows the surface: a browser view is captured as a screenshot of the real page at the real route, terminal or CLI output as the real transcript of the real command, a generated file or payload as its real content.

1. **Before is a capture of the real surface as it stands today.** Run the project, reach the affected surface, and capture it: the real page at the real route, the real command with its real output, the real generated content. A written description of the current look is never a before. The one exception is a surface that does not exist yet - say so in a line and go straight to the after.
2. **After is always an artifact, never prose alone.** In order of preference: a capture of the change running in a throwaway prototype; a mock rendered in the project's own design system; a diagram. If prototyping the after looks too expensive, that is evidence the change is under-specified - settle what it should be first. It is not an exemption.
   The single carve-out is a change no still capture can hold, meaning motion, timing, or a measurement, and then a recording or the measured result is the artifact. Name the form you used and why a still could not carry the claim. "I could not show it" with nothing attached is not a carve-out; it is a missing after.
3. **One tight capture per claim, placed beside the claim it evidences.** Do not dump a single full-page image or an entire transcript at the top and leave the reader to map it back onto the text.
4. **Crop and annotate down to the region that changed.** A full-page image offered as proof that one element moved, or a whole log offered as proof of one changed line, makes the reviewer do the diffing.
5. **Prose is reserved for what cannot be shown** - rationale, trade-offs, and open questions.

## Producing the artifacts
Build every prototype and capture inside this worktree, under \`.fm-scratch/\`: create the directory and write a single \`*\` line into \`.fm-scratch/.gitignore\`, which hides the whole directory from git without touching the project's own ignore file.
A prototype is scratch: never commit it to your \`fm/$ID\` branch, and expect it to die with this worktree.
Capture browser surfaces with \`chrome-devtools-axi\`.
If you conclude an artifact cannot be produced without writing outside this worktree and its evidence directory, append \`blocked: {why}\` and stop; that is an escalation, not a licence to write anywhere else.

## Delivering the artifacts
Copy every artifact you present out of \`.fm-scratch/\` into this task's own evidence directory, which outlives this worktree: run \`mkdir -p $EVIDENCE_DIR\` and copy them there, keeping the layout flat with one file per claim.
Link each artifact by its path beside the claim it evidences - in the pull request body when this project opens one, in the summary you hand back when it does not - never as a block at the bottom.
Write that path in the home-relative form \`$EVIDENCE_REL/{file}\`, never the absolute path you just gave \`mkdir\`: a pull request body can be published, and the absolute form would put this machine's account name and home layout in it.
When the pull request is opened for you, add those links to its body with \`gh-axi\` as soon as it exists, appending to the body it already has and preserving every line of it rather than replacing it, because a project can require a signature or a section in that body and a replacement drops it and fails a required check; when you open it yourself, write them into the body you author; when there is no pull request, name this directory in the hand-back you return.
Treat that as check-then-repair rather than a one-shot edit: the pipeline owns a body it opened and a rerun or any other republish overwrites what you wrote, so read the body back with \`gh-axi\`, confirm every link is still present before you report this task done, and add them again if they are gone.
Adding those links is not a code edit and not a findings fix, so it is not the hand-editing that an active validation run forbids.
Write each claim so the prose carries it on its own: a path is opaque to a reader who cannot open the file, so the sentence states what changed and the artifact confirms it. That is not prose standing in for an after; the artifact stays mandatory.
Accept the one limitation rather than working around it: a reviewer who is not on this machine cannot open these files, so for work whose pull request goes to a public upstream the artifacts are the captain's verification rather than the upstream reviewer's, and the self-carrying prose above is what keeps that pull request readable for both.
That is also why the artifacts go nowhere else, not to a gist and not to any other host: a secret gist is unlisted rather than access-controlled, so anyone holding the link could read captures of a private product.

You are a crewmate: an autonomous worker agent managed by firstmate. Work on your own; do not wait for a human.

# Task
{TASK}

$HERDR_SECTION

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of $REPO, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.

**Verify isolation before anything else.** Run \`pwd -P\` and \`git rev-parse --show-toplevel\`; both must resolve to the disposable task worktree you were launched in, such as a treehouse pool path or an Orca-managed worktree, not the primary checkout firstmate operates from.
The path check is authoritative: \`git rev-parse --git-dir\` and \`git rev-parse --git-common-dir\` can help inspect the repo, but they do not prove you are outside the primary checkout.
If the top-level path is the primary checkout or not the worktree you were launched in, STOP - do not branch or commit here - append \`blocked: launched in primary checkout, not an isolated worktree\` to the status file and stop.

1. First action: create your branch: \`git checkout -b fm/$ID\`$SETUP2

# Rules
$RULE1
$RULE2
3. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
   When browser work is finished, first navigate to \`about:blank\`, then close the browser.
   Park first because it is the half that survives failure: an abandoned page keeps rendering at full CPU indefinitely, and parking still holds if the close is missed or the task ends mid-run.
4. Report status by appending one line:
   \`echo "{state}: {one short line}" >> $STATUS_FILE\`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on (setup done, bug reproduced, fix implemented, validation passed) and the
   needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step FYI progress lines;
   firstmate reads your pane for that.
   A mid-task \`working:\` line (including setup complete) is nonterminal: do not end the
   turn after it; continue the same stage until a defined \`done:\` gate under Definition of done.
   Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` - distinct from \`blocked:\` - ONLY when you are deliberately idling on a
   known external wait you expect to clear on its own (an upstream release, a rate-limit reset,
   a scheduled window): firstmate then leaves your idle pane alone and rechecks it on a long
   cadence instead of treating it as a possible wedge. Use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need help.
5. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append \`blocked: {why}\` and stop; firstmate will help.
6. If a decision belongs above the implementation worker (product choices, destructive actions, ask-user findings),
   append \`needs-decision: {summary of options}\` and stop. Firstmate will apply the configured authority and reply with the decision.
   When firstmate replies or a blocker clears and you resume, append \`resolved: {how it was decided or unblocked}\` (add the same \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) so the decision or blocker is durably closed and does not keep resurfacing.
7. Never stop, restart, or update the shared \`no-mistakes\` daemon - it is one instance serving
   every lane/home, so restarting it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs. On ANY no-mistakes
   daemon error, append \`blocked: {the daemon error}\` and stop; only firstmate manages the daemon.

# Project memory
If \`AGENTS.md\` or \`CLAUDE.md\` already exists, or if this task produced durable project-intrinsic knowledge, run \`$FM_ROOT/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh .\` in the worktree.
Record only project knowledge useful to almost every future session.
For anything the codebase already shows, prefer a pointer to the authoritative file, command, or doc over copying the detail.
If you touch a project \`AGENTS.md\` that lacks \`## Maintaining this file\`, add that short self-governance section from \`$FM_ROOT/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh\` in the same pass.
Keep it proportionate: skip \`AGENTS.md\` edits for trivial tasks that produced no durable project knowledge.
